	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({ConvNets}) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up {MobileNets} and {ResNet}. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called {EfficientNets}, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous {ConvNets}. In particular, our {EfficientNet}-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing {ConvNet}. Our {EfficientNets} also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on {CIFAR}-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
