\section{Addressing this work to the criteria}
In this appendix, we analyze our report against the established criteria. We evaluate whether and how we meet the checklist mentioned in the criteria and specifically link to the section of the report where these elements can be found. Furthermore, we understand the efforts for grading so many reports with so a small teaching team are considerable and, with this section, we aim to (also) alleviate to our best these efforts.
